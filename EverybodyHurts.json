"[\"when your day is long and the night the night is yours alone when you're sure you've had enough of this life well hang on  don't let yourself go 'cause everybody cries and everybody hurts sometimes  sometimes everything is wrong now it's time to sing along when your day is night alone hold on hold on if you feel like letting go hold on if you think you've had too much of this life well hang on  everybody hurts take comfort in your friends everybody hurts don't throw your hand oh no  don't throw your hand if you feel like you're alone no no no you are not alone  if you're on your own in this life the days and nights are long when you think you've had too much of this life to hang on  well everybody hurts sometimes everybody cries everybody hurts sometimes and everybody hurts sometimes  so hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on everybody hurts\"]"
