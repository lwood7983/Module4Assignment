"[\"do you ever feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind wanting to start again do you ever feel feel so paperthin like a house of cards one blow from caving in do you ever feel already buried deep six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing do you know that there's still a chance for you 'cause there's a spark in you  pre you just gotta ignite the light and let it shine just own the night like the fourth of july   'cause baby you're a firework come on show 'em what you're worth make 'em go aah aah aah as you shoot across the sky baby you're a firework come on let your colors burst make 'em go aah aah aah you're gonna leave them all in awe awe awe   you don't have to feel like a waste of space you're original cannot be replaced if you only knew what the future holds after a hurricane comes a rainbow maybe a reason why all the doors are closed so you could open one that leads you to the perfect road like a lightning bolt your heart will glow and when it's time you'll know  pre you just gotta ignite the light and let it shine just own the night like the fourth of july   'cause baby you're a firework come on show 'em what you're worth make 'em go aah aah aah as you shoot across the sky baby you're a firework come on let your colors burst make 'em go aah aah aah you're gonna leave them all in awe awe awe   boom boom boom even brighter than the moon moon moon it's always been inside of you you you and now it's time to let it through   'cause baby you're a firework come on show 'em what you're worth make 'em go aah aah aah as you shoot across the sky baby you're a firework come on let your colors burst make 'em go aah aah aah you're gonna leave them all in awe awe awe   boom boom boom even brighter than the moon moon moon boom boom boom even brighter than the moon moon moon\"]"
